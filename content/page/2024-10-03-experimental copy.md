description: In my "expert lab" class, I experimented with Leap Motion and Kinect to create interactive visuals. I used Kinect with MediaPipe for real-time reactive visuals and Leap Motion to design a virtual instrument in Ableton Live and TouchDesigner.

    <p>During my "expert lab" class, I had the opportunity to explore various technologies and experiment with them. I
utilized the Leap Motion and Kinect to detect hands and human bodies, leveraging this data to produce engaging
visual effects.

I used the Kinect to create a visual that reacts on real-time data using the Kinect and MediaPipe. Besides that I used the Leap Motion to create "virtual instrument" using Ableton Live and TouchDesigner.</p>
