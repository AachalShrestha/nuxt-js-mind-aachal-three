    <p>Traditional Nepali dances are disappearing, with many on the verge of extinction. This website serves as a digital archive to preserve and showcase these beautiful dances, providing a resource for those interested in exploring Nepalâ€™s rich cultural heritage. Developed as a prototype for my WEB 2 class, the site allows users to discover detailed information about various dances and even create and save their own dance routines.

This project combined my personal passion for traditional Nepali dances with my web development skills. Concerned about the declining awareness of these cultural treasures, I wanted to create a platform that could serve as both a resource and a tool for preservation. Using MapBox.js, I integrated an interactive map to highlight the locations associated with the various dances. To ensure authenticity, I photographed the dancers to accurately capture the essence of each dance. Although the website is still a prototype, it has already managed to outline the structure and flow for an expanded archive in the future. The user interface is intuitively designed, encouraging exploration and engagement, with features that allow users to document and save their own dance routines.</p>
