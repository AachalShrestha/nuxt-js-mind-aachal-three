    <p>'Majipa Lakhey: The Protector' is an immersive installation that invites visitors to explore the Majipa Lakhey, a demon dance deeply embedded in Kathmandu's cultural traditions. Serving as my bachelor's thesis, the project aims to reconnect Nepali youth abroad with their cultural heritage and raise global awareness of Nepalese traditions. By engaging younger generations, it seeks to preserve this significant cultural symbol amidst a declining interest in traditional practices.

To create an engaging experience, I blended traditional storytelling with interactive technology. I used After Effects to craft a puppet-style animation, which was projected onto transparent fabric to evoke the myth's dreamlike quality, drawing inspiration from Nepalâ€™s puppetry tradition. The interactive demon dance was brought to life in Unity, using motion capture to ensure authenticity. I researched and replicated the demon's dance moves, while TouchDesigner and Kinect made the demon reactive, enhancing user engagement with real-time responses. This fusion of old and new aimed to make the cultural narrative immersive and accessible, especially for Nepali youth abroad who, like myself, may feel disconnected from their heritage.</p>
