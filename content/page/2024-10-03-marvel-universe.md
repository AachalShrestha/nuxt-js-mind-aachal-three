    <p>In this project, we were tasked with creating a poster from data provided in an Excel sheet detailing Marvel heroes and villains. My focus was on the villains, aiming to highlight their distinct attributes such as gender, eye color, and unique characteristics. The goal was to visually tell the story of how these attributes set villains apart from heroes.

As I analyzed the data, I noticed recurring traits among Marvel villains and wondered: what defines the perfect Marvel villain? I explored how their features set them apart from heroes. Inspired by Ikko Tanaka’s style, known for using simple geometric shapes to create impactful visuals, I adopted a similar approach to make the data more engaging and accessible. By distilling complex attributes into clean, geometric forms, I aimed to design a poster that is both informative and visually striking. Each visual element represents specific data points, like eye color and gender, ensuring the poster not only conveys information clearly but also embodies Tanaka’s design philosophy.</p>
