    <p>This projection mapping project illustrates the evolution of bits through Mario's journey. Starting with the original Donkey Kong game, Mario progresses through different games as the bit levels increase, showcasing the advancements in gaming technology.

During my college studies, my classmates and I had the opportunity to participate in the 2023 MASK Video Mapping Festival, which featured projections on the Tomas Bata University building. To bring our concept to life, we used After Effects for the overall animation. For animating Marioâ€™s movements, such as running and jumping, we employed a sprite-based approach. We utilized images of the building as references to align our animations accurately. Additionally, we created assets like ladders using Illustrator.</p>
